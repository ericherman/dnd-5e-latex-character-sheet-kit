This is a collection of LaTeX files which may be useful for recording
Dungeons & Dragons characters in a pure-text and git-friendly format.

Each layout element is designed to be reusable and hopefully modular
enough to be used for a variety of classes and layouts.

The examples show that the sheets are far from beautiful, but usable.

To see the examples, have a full LaTeX installed and simply type "make"
to produce an example paladin (Autun) and rogue (Kais).
